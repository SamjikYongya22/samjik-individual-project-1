            <h2>HTML Elements</h2>
            <p>
              HTML elements are the foundational components of web pages,
              representing the structure and content of a document. Each HTML
              element is enclosed within opening and closing tags, and together,
              they form the structure of a webpage. Elements can be as simple as
              a paragraph or a heading , or more complex, like images , links ,
              forms , and tables . Elements serve to semantically define the
              meaning of content, aiding accessibility and search engine
              optimization. Attributes can be added to elements to provide
              additional information or functionality, such as specifying image
              sources or defining form behavior. HTML elements are the building
              blocks that enable web developers to create well-structured,
              interactive, and visually engaging web pages.

          <div class="html-grid-2">
            <h2>HTML Attributes</h2>
            <p>
              HTML attributes are essential components within HTML elements that
              provide additional information or configure an element's behavior.
              They are always specified within the opening tag of an element and
              consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (e.g.,
              attribute="value"). Attributes can be global, applying to multiple
              types of elements, or specific to certain elements. Common global
              attributes include class (for assigning CSS classes), id (for
              unique identification), and style (for inline CSS styling).
              Specific attributes depend on the element; for instance, the src
              attribute specifies the source of an image (<img />), while the
              href attribute defines the destination of a link (/a/). Attributes
              play a crucial role in enhancing the functionality, accessibility,
              and styling of web content, making them an integral part of HTML
              markup.

            <h2>HTML Comments</h2>
            <p>
              HTML comments are a way to add notes or annotations within the
              HTML code of a web page that are not displayed in the browser.
              They are enclosed in
              <!-- (start of comment) and -->
              (end of comment) and can span multiple lines. HTML comments are
              used for various purposes, such as explaining code to other
              developers, temporarily disabling code for testing, or leaving
              reminders for future modifications. Comments are ignored by web
              browsers and do not affect the rendering of the webpage. They are
              a valuable tool for maintaining well-documented and organized HTML
              code, enhancing collaboration among developers, and ensuring the
              clarity and maintainability of web projects.

            <h2>HTML Favicon</h2>
            <p>
              An HTML favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, square
              image typically displayed in the browser's tab or bookmarks bar
              when a user visits a website. This tiny graphic, usually in the
              .ico format or other image formats like .png, .jpg, or .gif,
              serves as a visual identifier for a website. Favicon files are
              referenced in the HTML document using the /link/ element within
              the /head/ section, and they provide branding and recognition for
              the site. Having a favicon enhances a website's professionalism
              and makes it easily recognizable among a user's open tabs or
              bookmarks, contributing to a more cohesive and memorable user
              experience.

            <h2>HTML Table</h2>
            <p>
              HTML tables are a fundamental element used to display data in a
              structured, grid-like format on web pages. Tables are constructed
              using a combination of tags, including table for defining the
              table itself, tr for table rows, th for table headers, and td for
              table data cells. Tables can be used for a wide range of purposes,
              such as presenting tabular data, organizing information, creating
              calendars, or even designing page layouts. They offer versatility
              in terms of customization through CSS styling and allow for the
              grouping of related data into rows and columns. While tables have
              been largely replaced by CSS for layout purposes, they remain
              essential for displaying data in a structured and organized manner
              on web pages, providing clarity and accessibility to users.

          <div class="html-grid-6">
            <h2>HTML Class</h2>
            <p>
              In HTML, a "class" is an attribute that can be applied to one or
              more HTML elements to group them together for styling or scripting
              purposes. Classes are particularly useful for applying consistent
              styles to multiple elements across a web page without having to
              redefine those styles individually for each element. CSS, along
              with JavaScript, can target elements with specific classes and
              apply styles or behaviors accordingly. This allows for greater
              flexibility and maintainability in web design and development, as
              it separates the structure (HTML) from the presentation (CSS) and
              functionality (JavaScript) of a web page, promoting a more
              organized and scalable approach to building websites. HTML classes
              are versatile tools for achieving a cohesive and visually
              appealing design and enhancing the interactivity of web pages.

            <h2>HTML layout</h2>
            <p>
              HTML layout refers to the way web page content is structured and
              organized, defining the arrangement of elements on a webpage.
              Layout is crucial for creating visually appealing and
              user-friendly websites. HTML5 introduced semantic layout elements
              like `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, and `footer`,
              which provide a clear and meaningful structure to content. CSS is
              commonly used to style and position elements within these layout
              structures, enabling web designers to control spacing, alignment,
              and responsiveness. Modern web design often employs responsive
              layouts, ensuring that web content adapts seamlessly to various
              screen sizes and devices, enhancing user experience. HTML layout
              is a cornerstone of web development, as it influences the
              presentation and functionality of web pages, making them more
              accessible, visually appealing, and responsive to user needs.

            <h2>HTML Symbol</h2>
            <p>
              HTML symbols, also known as character entities or HTML entities,
              are special codes used to display characters or symbols that are
              not easily typable on a standard keyboard or may have special
              meaning in HTML code. These entities begin with an ampersand (`&`)
              and end with a semicolon (`;`). For example, `&lt;` represents the
              less-than symbol `<`, and `&copy;` represents the copyright symbol
              Â©. HTML symbols are used to ensure that specific characters are
              correctly displayed in web content, preventing conflicts with HTML
              markup and improving accessibility. They are especially handy for
              displaying special characters, mathematical symbols, arrows, and
              non-Latin characters. By using HTML symbols, web developers can
              ensure consistent rendering across different browsers and devices
              while maintaining the integrity of the HTML code.

              HTML entities, also known as character entities, are special codes
              used to represent characters or symbols that have special meaning
              in HTML or are not easily typed using standard keyboard input.
              HTML entities are used to ensure that these characters display
              correctly in web content. They begin with an ampersand (`&`) and
              end with a semicolon (`;`). For example, `&lt;` represents the

              Â©. HTML entities are essential for preventing conflicts with HTML
              markup, improving accessibility, and ensuring that specific
              characters render consistently across different web browsers and
              devices. They are particularly useful for displaying special
              characters, mathematical symbols, currency symbols, and non-Latin
              characters, making web content more inclusive and accurate.

            <h2>HTML responsive</h2>
            <p>
              HTML responsiveness, often referred to as "responsive web design,"
              is a web development approach aimed at creating websites that
              adapt and display effectively on a variety of devices and screen
              sizes. It involves using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript to
              ensure that web content reflows, resizes, and adjusts its layout
              to fit different screens, from large desktop monitors to small
              mobile devices. Key techniques include fluid layouts, media
              queries, and flexible images. Responsive design improves user
              experience by making content more accessible and readable,
              regardless of the device being used. It's essential in the modern
              web, as users access websites from a wide range of devices, and
              responsive design ensures that a consistent and user-friendly
              experience is maintained across all of them.

            development, providing the structure and semantics for web content.
            These tags, enclosed within angle brackets, define various elements
            like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists. HTML tags are
            the building blocks of web pages, offering structure, meaning, and
            accessibility to content. Attributes can be added to tags for
            additional information and functionality. With the proper use of
            HTML tags and attributes, web developers can create well-structured,
            interactive, and visually appealing websites that cater to both
            users and search engines.

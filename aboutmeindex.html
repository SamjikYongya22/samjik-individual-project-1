        Hello everyone. I am the author of this blog. My name is Samjik Hang
        Yongya. I am from Jhapa, Nepal and currently living in Ulsan, Korea. I
        am an IT student, currently studing in the Ulsan College. Before I was
        interested in art and literature but its been nearly a year that i have
        eye on web design. I find it very fun and interesting. I hope I will be
        good at web designing in upcoming days. Generally, in Nepal, theoretical
        studies aq11qre more focused than practical. So, growing up I was taught
        to be more attentive towards my theory rather than practical. I was
        never interested in science and technology but rather enjoyed art and
        literature. I used to like reading stories and dramas. I even like
        drawing and painting and enjoy my free time doing them as my hobby. So,
        I completed my high school in 2019 and started to learn German language.
        From there I got to know in depth about coding. At first, I was very
        confused seeing the codes which were like huge amount. Later, I got
        interested and got to know it is very important to learn to survive in
        todayâ€™s generation. That was the reason I started to learn coding. I
        like web designing. Web designing seems interesting.
